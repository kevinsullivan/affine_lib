# 2 K Vector Space

Lin2kcoord.lean instantiates Lean's vector space operations for 2-D (2-coordinate) vectors, with coordinates drawn from a field, K. Vector addition is denoted + and scalar multiplication by \bu (in Lean). You can see examples of code using this API in the lin2kcoord_test.lean file.
